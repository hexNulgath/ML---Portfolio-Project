Fixed-time traffic light systems lack the ability to respond effectively to temporal variations in traffic demand, resulting in suboptimal performance under real-world conditions.\n","\n","In this notebook, the SUMO traffic simulator is employed to recreate the intersection and generate realistic traffic dynamics, while TensorFlow is used to develop and train a learning-based traffic signal controller. Through repeated interaction with the simulation environment, the reinforcement learning agent learns policies that adapt signal timings in response to observed traffic states, with the goal of reducing congestion and improving traffic efficiency.\n","\n","The notebook is designed to be executed in Google Colab, enabling reproducibility and ease of experimentation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0FhHH2w0JMQb"},"source":["## PATHS"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BCIrhULf_zlN"},"source":["### Paths and global variables\n","This section mounts Google Drive and defines all file paths and global parameters used throughout the notebook.

It maps each timestamp to simulation seconds, selects the corresponding lane-level measurements, and aggregates demand by origin edge. For each origin, total volume is split into turning movements using predefined probabilities and converted to vehicles per hour over a fixed time window. Each movement is then added as a unique `flow` element to the routes file, enabling time-varying demand that follows the observed data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2htEAxHnakNs"},"outputs":[],"source":["def sequential_ts(ts_list):\n","  global SIM_START_TS\n","  SIM_START_TS = ts_list[0]\n","  for ts in ts_list:\n","        sequential_flow(ts)\n","\n","def ts_to_sim_seconds(ts):\n","    return int((ts - SIM_START_TS).total_seconds())\n","\n","def sequential_flow(ts):\n","    global flow_id\n","    group = selection(ts)\n","\n","    begin = ts_to_sim_seconds(ts)\n","    end = begin + FLOW_TIME_BIN\n","\n","    window_hours = FLOW_TIME_BIN / 3600.0\n","\n","    for origin_edge, lanes in LANES_BY_ORIGIN.items():\n","\n","        volume_total = group.loc[\n","            group[\"name\"].isin(lanes),\n","            \"hourly_volume\"\n","        ].sum()\n","\n","        if volume_total <= 0:\n","            continue\n","\n","        for movement, prob in TURN_PROB.items():\n","\n","            route_id = ROUTES_BY_ORIGIN[origin_edge][movement]\n","            movement_volume = volume_total * prob\n","            vehs_per_hour = movement_volume / window_hours\n","\n","            SubElement(\n","                routes,\n","                \"flow\",\n","                id=f\"flow_{flow_id}\",\n","                begin=str(begin),\n","                end=str(end),\n","                vehsPerHour=f\"{vehs_per_hour:.2f}\",\n","                type=VEH_TYPE_ID,\n","                departLane=\"best\",\n","                departSpeed=\"max\",\n","                route=route_id\n","            )\n","\n","            flow_id += 1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ur1d6AHQOzUe"},"source":["This section orchestrates the creation of traffic flows over multiple simulation time steps.
